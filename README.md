# ADS-Laboratory
The aim of this repository is to store all my laboratory work of Advanced Digital Systems (ADS).
## What is inside?
Basically all the VHDL and Verilog files for the designs. Also some C files for the implementation on the board can be found too.
## Can I use your work?
Of course as long as you respect the terms of the license.
